# TicTacToe

A simple CLI application to play TicTacToe and illustrate alpha beta pruning. 

The application framework is based on a simple implementation of Harel statecharts. The framework should run different games which are defined by
subclassing the Board abstractclass and implementing all required methods. 

To run the game application: 

    $ python game.py <name of class defining the game>
